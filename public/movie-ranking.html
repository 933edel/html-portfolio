<h3>The wolf of wall street</h3>
<p>An amazing story based on the real life businessman Jordan Belfort. The movie has some beautiful life lessons interlaced with brilliant comedy and marvellous performances.</p>

<h3>Man of Steel</h3>
<p>A great movie about none other than the Superman. The last son of Krypton has a lot to learn from. The score is fantastic and the production and performances kick ass!</p>

<h3>The Great Gatsby</h3>
<p>Based on the legendary novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, this one is a joy to watch. The representation of New York in the late 1900s is amazing and the visual metaphors are a cherry on the cake.</p>
